/// The "backing store" that a renderable terminal uses to tell which glyphs
/// actually need rendering.
///
/// Drawing a glyph on screen is the most expensive operation a terminal
/// performs, so we want to avoid doing that when not necessary. The simplest
/// solution is to render the glyphs that are drawn when terminal draw call is
/// made. However, it's common for a given terminal cell to be drawn multiple
/// times between updates. Often, the final result is the same as what was
/// previously on screen.
///
/// For example, consider a terminal for a game. It renders a "." floor tile,
/// then renders the "/" on top of that for an item on the floor, then a "M"
/// for the monster standing on that tile. The end user only sees the "M". The
/// next frame, the process repeats and the ".", "/", and "M" are drawn.
///
/// If we render eagerly, that's a ton of wasted effort to end up with the same
/// pixels that are on screen. What we want is to let the code modify as many
/// glyphs as it wants as many times as it wants. Once that entire draw process
/// is complete, we see which glyphs ended up different from the last time the
/// terminal was shown to the user and just render those.
///
/// That's what this class does. It maintains two arrays of glyphs. One
/// represents what was last shown to the user. The other represents what
/// modifications have been made to the terminal since then. When the terminal
/// is written to, this keeps track of which glyphs are actually different from
/// the last render and which are the same.
///
/// Once that's done, you can call [render]. That will invoke the callback to
/// actually draw a glyph, but only for the ones that are actually modified.
